### A long and boring official bio ðŸ‘‹

Krzysztof Czarnecki is a University Research Chair and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and at the University of Waterloo and a Licensed Professional Engineer in Ontario, Canada. He heads the Waterloo Intelligent Systems Engineering (WISE) Laboratory. He is a leading expert in the safety of automated driving systems (ADS), with focus on assuring the safety of driving behavior and machine-learned functions. As part of his research, he has co-led the development of UW Moose (started in 2016), Canadaâ€™s first self-driving research vehicle, which has been tested on public roads since 2018. His recent research contributions related to ADS safety assurance include an uncertainty-centric framework for assuring the safety of perceptual components based on machine learning, a framework for specifying driving behavior requirements, and methods for modeling and sampling road user behavior. He serves on SAE task forces on driving automation definitions, reference architecture, and maneuvers and behaviors, the Canadian Mirror Committee of ISO TC 22/SC 32 (contributions to ISO 21448 Safety of the Intended Functionality and ISO/PAS 8800 Road Vehicles â€” Safety and artificial intelligence), and the UL STP 4600 Evaluation of Autonomous Products standards committee. He served on the Expert Panel on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles and Shared Mobility of the Council of Canadian Academies, advising the Canadian government (2019-2020). Over the last decade, he has collaborated with and received grants from automotive OEMs (e.g., GM) and suppliers (e.g., Denso, Renesas), technology companies (e.g., Blackberry, Huawei, Maplesoft), and consumer organizations (e.g., AAA Northern California) on improving driving automation, including its safety assurance. Before working on automated driving, he advised Pratt and Whitney Canada on creating reusable software designs and components for aircraft engine control systems (2011-2015). Before coming to Waterloo, he was a researcher at DaimlerChrysler Research (1995-2002), Germany, focusing on improving software development practices and technologies in automotive, aerospace, and enterprise sectors. He co-authored the book on "Generative Programming" (Addison- Wesley, 2000), which pioneered automated software engineering based on feature modeling, domain-specific languages, and program generation. While at Waterloo, he held the NSERC/Bank of Nova Scotia Industrial Research Chair in Requirements Engineering of Service-oriented Software Systems (2008-2013) and worked on methods and tools for engineering complex software-intensive systems. He received the Premier's Research Excellence Award in 2004 and the British Computing Society in Upper Canada Award for Outstanding Contributions to IT Industry in 2008. He has also received eight Best Paper Awards, two ACM Distinguished Paper Awards, and four Most Influential Paper Awards. His publications have been widely cited (over 30,000 citations on Google Scholar).
